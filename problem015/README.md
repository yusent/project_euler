Lattice paths
======

Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a N x M grid? As number of ways can be very large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.

##### Input Format:
The first line contains an integer T, i.e., number of test cases.
Next T lines will contain integers N and M.

##### Output Format:
Print the values corresponding to each test case.

##### Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 103  
1 ≤ N ≤ 500  
1 ≤ M ≤ 500  

##### Sample Input:
```
2
2 2
3 2
```

##### Sample Output:
```
6
10
```
